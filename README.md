## About Me
I'm an aspiring programmer, a little cheese in search of adventures! With a passion for game and website development, I design 3D models and code in Java, C#, Typecript and Python. I'm a sucker for complex coding puzzles and interactive applications. Let's create something extraordinary together! 🚀

<!--
I'm currenlty updating the [Misty World](https://github.com/Liahim85/MistyWorld_Open) Minecraft mod, as an effort to teach people about ecology, and the effects on the environment in it's own species.
-->
I'm currenlty developing [Nölme](https://github.com/Mr-ConQueso/nolme-app), a passion project of mine, combining progamming and my love of J.R.R. Tolkien and his in-depth languages.
