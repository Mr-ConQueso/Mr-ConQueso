## About Me
I'm an aspiring programmer, a little cheese in search of adventures! With a passion for game and website development, I enjoy designing 3D models and coding in Java, C#, and Python and crafting immersive gaming experiences or building dynamic web applications, I thrive on the challenges and creativity that programming offers. Let's create something extraordinary together! 🚀

I'm currenlty updating the [Misty World](https://github.com/Liahim85/MistyWorld_Open) Minecraft mod, as an effort to teach people about ecology, and the effects on the environment in it's own species.
